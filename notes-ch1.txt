Follows the code in chapter 1 of Modern Full-Stack React Projects by Daniel Bugl

Packages:
- prettier: Formats code automatically due to a defined code style
- eslint: Analyzes code automatically and enforces best practices
- eslint-config-react: Enables rules in ESLint relevant to React projects
- eslint-config-prettier: Disables rules relating to code style in ESLint (handled by Prettier)
- eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y: Allows ESling to check for accessibility (a11y) issues in our jsx code

Note: --save-dev flag in npm install
- saves dependencies as dev dependencies, which will not be installed in a deployed app to minimize the size of containers

Prettier
- Formats code (replacing the default code formatter provided by VS Code)
- Configuration is found in .prettierrc.json
- Create an ignore file to list files that should not be automatically formatted (/node_modules is automatically excluded)
